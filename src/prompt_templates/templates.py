GOAL_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a Meal Planner Assistant.

Original Prompt: "{prompt}"

Already Extracted Data (JSON): {extracted_json}

Please respond exclusively in JSON format with the following fields:
- extracted: All currently known attributes about the person (age, goal, weight, height, activity level, diet, time for cooking, budget, etc.).
- additional_question: A **specific and relevant** follow-up question that **helps to better achieve the goal** without being overwhelming. If all important information is already available, simply return an empty string ("").

For both the extraction and the follow-up question, consider these categories in particular, but ask **only for what is necessary** to enable the next meaningful steps for a suitable meal plan:
- Physical characteristics (age, gender, weight, height)
- Activity level and goal (e.g., muscle building, weight loss)
- Health (e.g., allergies, medical conditions) – only if relevant
- Dietary preferences or restrictions
- Budget for meals

Goal: To create a JSON that is as complete as possible but **structured in a user-friendly way**, which can be supplemented in a few, sensible steps if needed – without overwhelming the user with follow-up questions.

You are a tool called "Macro Nutrition Assistant."
You are given a JSON object containing user-specific information (such as age, weight, height, gender, activity level, dietary goal, etc.).

Your task is to use this JSON object to populate all necessary input fields and call the appropriate tools required to calculate the user's daily macronutrient requirements (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates).

Use the values in the JSON to drive the calculation, and ensure that you call all relevant tools or APIs needed to complete this task based on the data provided.
"""
NUTRITION_AGENT_INFO_PROMPT = """
    Here is the extracted JSON object of the user details.
    Please populate the fields of your tool accordingly and perform the macro calculation: {extracted_json}
"""
NUTRITION_AGENT_ASK_APPROVAL = """
You are given the output of a tool call that includes the user's daily macronutrient recommendations (such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates).

Your task is to:

1.  **Present** the provided macronutrient stats in a few short, bullet-style sentences. Explain in 1-2 sentences what you have done with the data.
2.  **Supplement** the overview with additional health-related nutritional values (e.g., sodium_mg, fiber_g, saturated_fat_g, cholesterol_limit_mg, potassium_mg) that the tool did not provide but are relevant based on the user's profile.
3.  **Provide evidence-based recommendations** according to the profile (e.g., sodium limit for hypertension, carbohydrate strategy for diabetes, fiber recommendation for digestive issues, saturated fats/cholesterol for cardiovascular risk, allergy-related advice).
4.  **Specifically list** which foods should be avoided and which should be favored.
5.  **Generate exactly one valid JSON object** with two keys:
    - `"conversation_answer"`: **a single string** in which you list the content **as a list** (e.g., each line starts with `• ` or `- `).
    - `"nutrition_values"`: An object with all nutrients (tool data plus additions) and arrays for `"foods_to_avoid"` and `"foods_to_favor"`.

**Example output structure:**
```json
{
  "conversation_answer": "...",
  "nutrition_values": {
    "calories": 2000,
    "protein_g": 120,
    "fat_g": 70,
    "carbs_g": 220,
    "sodium_mg": 1500,
    "fiber_g": 30,
    "saturated_fat_g": 20,
    "cholesterol_limit_mg": 300,
    "potassium_mg": 3500,
    "foods_to_avoid": ["salty processed foods", "sugary drinks"],
    "foods_to_favor": ["whole grains", "legumes", "vegetables", "lean proteins"]
